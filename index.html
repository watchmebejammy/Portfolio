        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a highly motivated and efficient individual currently pursuing a BSc (Hons) in Computer Science
            at the University of South Wales. With a strong background in customer service, administration, and IT,
            I bring excellent communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills to the table.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond academics, I enjoy exploring complex questions and challenging the norm. Whether researching innovative
            business strategies, questioning the fundamental principles of physics, or brainstorming new ideas in robotics,
            I am always eager to expand my horizons and think critically.
